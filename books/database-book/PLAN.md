name: Database Book Online Reader
status: pending (not yet executed)
created: 2026-05-26
overview: Build out this empty `database-book/` folder into a self-contained static online book. It holds source MD files + images, builds them into a static HTML reader with a left navigation sidebar and reading-progress bar (warm cream/green theme reused from the BITM330 workspace's `book-platform/`). First pass uses mockup MD content for the first 3 chapters so the reader can be verified before real content is migrated. The old `book-platform/` (in the BITM330-book-drive workspace) gets archived afterwards.

# Database Book -- Online Reader Plan

## Goal

A self-contained, portable book project that:

1. Holds the book's source MD files and images inside it.
2. Has a Python build script that converts each MD file to an HTML page.
3. Outputs a static reader (HTML/CSS/JS) with a left navigation sidebar and a reading-progress bar.
4. Lives here in the `dima-publishing` repo (not BITM330-book-drive), so it is publishable independently.
5. Replaces the older `book-platform/` in the BITM330-book-drive workspace (which has the sidebar but no progress bar and reads from `BITM330-Book-draft/chapter-drafts/` instead of being self-contained).

## Two repos involved

- **Source repo (current Cursor workspace):** `g:\My Drive\0-Projects\!-important\BITM330-book-drive\` -- holds the existing `book-platform/` (to be archived) and the manuscript drafts in `BITM330-Book-draft/chapter-drafts/`.
- **Target repo (this one):** `C:\Users\nd115232\Documents\GitHub\dima-publishing\` -- the standalone publishing repo. The `books/database-book/` folder already exists but is empty; this is where everything below gets created.

## Decisions confirmed

- Project location: `dima-publishing/books/database-book/` (this folder)
- First pass content: mockup MD files for the first 3 chapters (placeholders), not a full migration
- Theme: keep the warm cream/green palette from `BITM330-book-drive/book-platform/app/static/styles.css`

## Proposed folder structure

All paths below are relative to this `database-book/` folder.

## How a page is built

    J[theme/assets/] --> K[Copy to dist/assets/]
    L[source/**/images/] --> M[Copy to dist/images/]
```

## Reader features (rendered into every chapter page)

- Left sidebar: collapsible chapter list, with parts (`main`, `lets-build`, `terms`, `reflection`, `rat`, `lab`) nested under each chapter; active chapter and part highlighted.
- Progress bar: thin bar fixed at top of viewport that fills as the reader scrolls through the current part, plus a small "Ch 5 of 17" indicator in the sidebar.
- Prev/Next buttons at bottom of each part (keyboard left/right also works via `reader.js`).
- Mobile-responsive: sidebar collapses to a hamburger drawer on narrow screens.

## Key file responsibilities

All paths below are inside this `database-book/` folder.

- `build.py`: orchestrates the whole build. Adapts the front-matter stripping and image-link rewriting logic from `BITM330-book-drive/book-platform/app/content.py` but writes static HTML files instead of serving them.
- `source/book.yaml`: single source of truth for chapter order and book-level metadata.
- `source/chapters/chXX-*/chapter.yaml`: per-chapter metadata (number, title, parts) so we don't rely on parsing folder names.
- `theme/templates/chapter.html`: the reader page template (sidebar + content + progress bar slots).
- `theme/assets/css/reader.css`: ports the cream/green palette from `BITM330-book-drive/book-platform/app/static/styles.css` and adds the progress-bar styles.
- `theme/assets/js/reader.js`: scroll-based progress bar, sidebar collapse, prev/next keyboard nav.

## Mockup content (first pass)

Three chapters scaffolded with mockup MD content so the build pipeline and reader UI can be verified end-to-end before any real content is migrated:

- `ch01-introduction-to-course/`
- `ch02-mis-and-bitm/`
- `ch03-what-is-data/`

Each gets all six parts (`main.md`, `lets-build.md`, `terms.md`, `reflection.md`, `rat.md`, `lab.md`) populated with short Lorem-ipsum-style placeholder text plus a few realistic structural elements (a heading, a paragraph, a bullet list, a code fence, a table, an image reference) so we exercise every rendering path. Real content can be dropped into these files later -- the structure stays the same.

Real-content migration from `BITM330-book-drive/BITM330-Book-draft/chapter-drafts/` into `dima-publishing/books/database-book/source/chapters/` is deferred to a follow-up pass once the reader is working.

## Existing `book-platform/` handling

After the new `database-book/` is working, archive `BITM330-book-drive/book-platform/` by moving it to `BITM330-book-drive/archive/book-platform-2026-05-26/` (matches the existing `archive/` convention in that workspace) and deleting the original.

## Stale plan copy to clean up

Earlier a copy of this plan was saved at `BITM330-book-drive/.github/plans/database-book-plan.md` based on a misread of "save it in the github folder". That location is wrong now -- the canonical plan lives here at `dima-publishing/books/database-book/PLAN.md`. The misplaced file should be deleted in the execution phase.

## Implementation order (todos)

1. Scaffold this `database-book/` folder with `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `build.py` skeleton, `.gitignore`.
2. Define `source/book.yaml` and per-chapter `chapter.yaml` schemas.
3. Create mockup MD files (six parts) for `ch01-introduction-to-course/`, `ch02-mis-and-bitm/`, `ch03-what-is-data/`.
4. Build the theme reusing the warm cream/green palette: `base.html`, `chapter.html`, `index.html`, sidebar + progress partials, `reader.css`, `markdown.css`, `reader.js`.
5. Implement `build.py`: walk `source/`, render each MD to a templated HTML page, rewrite image paths, copy assets, write `dist/`.
6. Add `serve.py` for local preview, run a smoke build, verify sidebar + progress bar work end-to-end against the mockup chapters.
7. Archive the old `BITM330-book-drive/book-platform/` to `BITM330-book-drive/archive/book-platform-2026-05-26/`.
8. Delete the stale plan copy at `BITM330-book-drive/.github/plans/database-book-plan.md`.
