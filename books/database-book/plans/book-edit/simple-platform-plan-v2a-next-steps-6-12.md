# Database Book Platform — Simple Master Plan

**Date:** 2026-06-12  
**Supersedes:** older `database-book-plan-*.md` files  
**Canonical refs:** `book-plan-codex.md`, `06-locked-decisions.md`

---




## Purpose

Build the database textbook platform in a practical sequence that supports the course now, while preparing for paid access later.

**Immediate goal:**
> Students can read the assigned chapters and labs when the course starts.

**Longer-term goal:**
> Students can log in, pay through Stripe, and access the protected textbook platform.

## The Big Picture — Five Stages

```
Stage 1 — v1.1 Course Reader          ✅ DONE — tagged reader-v1.1-stable
Stage 2 — v1.2 Source/Chapter Workflow ✅ DONE — stable filenames, book.yml, manifests
Stage 3 — Course Launch                ⏳ ACTIVE
Stage 4 — v2A Paid-Access Pilot        ⏳ NEXT — Claude pilot as base
Stage 5 — v2B Learning Features        🔒 DEFERRED
```

---

## Stage 1 — v1.1 Course Reader ✅

**Goal:** Freeze the course reader for student use.

**Location:** `platform-pilots/reader-hybrid-v1.1/`

**Status:** Built, deployed to Vercel, tagged `reader-v1.1-stable`. Do not modify.

---

## Stage 2 — v1.2 Source and Chapter Workflow ✅

**Goal:** Stable chapter filenames and editing workflow.

**Stable filenames per chapter:**
```
index.md
core-concepts.md
lets-build.md
review-questions.md
terms-treasury.md
rat.md
```

**Infrastructure created:**
```
books/database-book/book.yml
books/database-book/files/source/outline/book-outline.md
books/database-book/files/source/outline/chapter-registry.yml
books/database-book/files/manifests/source-import-manifest.csv
```

**Rule:** Git stores history. Do not use active dated filenames as working files.

---

## Stage 3 — Course Launch ⏳

**Goal:** Students can use the reader when the course starts.

**Must be ready:**
- v1.1 reader deployed with stable URL
- ch01–ch04 available (core concepts + labs)
- Mobile layout works
- No answer files exposed
- Unfinished chapters show "Coming Soon"

**Not required at launch:**
- Stripe, Supabase, student accounts, paid access, notes, progress

**Student-facing note:**
> The online reader is the primary textbook platform. Chapters and labs will be released progressively. The first assigned readings and labs are available now.

---

## Stage 4 — v2A Paid-Access Pilot ⏳

**Goal:** Test full paid-access flow before fall. Separate app, not mixed into v1.1.

**Location:** `platform-pilots/claude/` — use as the v2A app (Next.js 16 + Supabase + Stripe).

**Technology:** Next.js · TypeScript · Supabase Auth · Supabase Postgres + RLS · Stripe Checkout · Stripe Webhooks · Vercel

### Access Flow

```
student creates account
  ↓
student pays through Stripe Checkout
  ↓
Stripe sends signed webhook to /api/stripe/webhook
  ↓
server verifies webhook signature
  ↓
purchase + access_grant rows written via service role
  ↓
protected reader unlocks for that user
```

**Rule:** Never unlock access from the browser success page. Webhook only.

### Supabase Tables (v2A — 4 tables)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `access_grants` | Who can read the book; service-role writes only |
| `purchases` | Audit log of Stripe payments; service-role writes only |
| `processed_stripe_events` | Webhook idempotency |
| `profiles` | User display info; user reads/writes own row |

Migration file: `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`

### Chapter Access Logic

```
ch01-introduction → preview: true → FREE for everyone
ch02+             → preview: false → requires active access_grant
```

Logic in `src/app/book/[chapter]/page.tsx`:
```ts
const locked = !chapter.preview && !access;
```

`content/book.yaml` marks ch01 with `preview: true`.

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

| Variable | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | ✅ Set |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ✅ Set |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | ✅ Set |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | ✅ Set |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | ✅ Set |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` | ⏳ Needs real `price_XXXX` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | ✅ Set |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOK_PRODUCT_ID` | ✅ `database-book` |

### v2A Routes

```
/                              — home + pricing
/book                          — TOC (previews labeled; locked chapters shown)
/book/ch01-introduction        — FREE (preview)
/book/ch02-mis-and-bitm        — LOCKED (requires payment)
/auth/signup                   — register
/auth/login                    — sign in
/api/checkout                  — creates Stripe Checkout session
/api/stripe/webhook            — receives Stripe events
/api/auth/callback             — Supabase OAuth/magic-link callback
```

### v2A Validation Checklist

```
□ Logged-out visitor can read ch01
□ Logged-out visitor cannot read ch02
□ Signed-in unpaid user cannot read ch02
□ Stripe test checkout completes (card 4242 4242 4242 4242)
□ Webhook fires and access_grant row appears in Supabase
□ Signed-in paid user can read ch02
□ Duplicate webhook does not duplicate access_grant
□ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY never reaches the browser
```

### Deployment Steps

1. Apply migration in Supabase SQL Editor (`0001_init.sql`)
2. Create Stripe test product → copy `price_XXXX` into `.env`
3. `npm run dev` — local test against checklist above
4. `vercel --yes` — deploy
5. Add all 8 env vars to Vercel project
6. `vercel --prod --yes` — redeploy with vars
7. Configure Stripe webhook → `https://<vercel-url>/api/stripe/webhook` → event: `checkout.session.completed`
8. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel env, redeploy

## Stage 5 — v2B Learning Features 🔒 Deferred

Do not start until v2A is stable.

Planned features: progress tracking · student notes · lab submission · protected search · accessibility hardening

Not building yet: AI assistant · instructor dashboard · gradebook · LTI · real institutional SSO

---

## Editing Rules While Course Is Running

- Edit chapters in `books/database-book/files/source/chapters/`
- Use Git commits for version history — no active dated files
- Use branches for active edits: `content/ch02-revision`, `platform/v2a-paid-access`
- Keep `main` deployable; use preview branches for risky changes
- Never push lab answer files to the public source repo

---

## Priority Order

```
1.  ✅ v1.1 reader works and is deployed
2.  ⏳ First chapters and labs available for course start
3.  ⏳ Students can use the reader
4.  ⏳ Chapter editing workflow is stable
5.  ⏳ v2A paid-access pilot — Supabase + Stripe tested in test mode
6.  🔒 v2B learning features — after v2A is proven
```

---

## Simple Summary

| Horizon | Goal |
|---------|------|
| Now | Course reader deployed, ch01–ch04 available |
| Next | Source/content workflow stable |
| Summer | v2A: Supabase + Stripe pilot tested |
| Fall | Use paid access only after test-mode flow is proven |
